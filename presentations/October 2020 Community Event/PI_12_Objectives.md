# PI 12 Objectives
## Performance 
•	Production ready MVP, consisting of happy path plus a limited set of non-happy path use cases that are fully QA'd (resilient & consistent)

•	Phase 5 plan to have the complete production ready central-ledger

##	ISO 20020 
•	How to settle in an ISO world

•	POC

•	Draft ISO Business justification

•	Contributing member of ISO RTP group

##	Implement Cascading Timeouts 
•	Scheme specified cascaded timeouts [using durations, headers] are  implemented

•	Draft proposals for changes to the ML APIs made to CCB/SIGs

•	Design changes needed to support cascaded timeouts natively without affecting JWS / end-to-end encryption [Stretch]

##	Business Operations Framework 
•	Define business objectives

•	Develop v1 UX for Business

•	Define APIs required

##	Accelerate Engagement with the value proposition  (was Training and onboarding for SI’s)
•	We have an articulated value proposition for the chosen personas

•	Use the uncdf tanzania opportunity to understand what happens when there is SI traction

•	Stretch:  we need to understand GSMA perspective (as an influencer)

##	PISP 
•	Finish linking design and implementation

•	Packaging and consolidation of code and docs

•	Facilitate input on 3p use cases.
 
# Other Workstreams – Objective TBD
##	PDP/Testing toolkit: 
•	Reach parity with Postman end-to-end test coverage for validating Switch, FSP implementations (for TTK), so Schemes can be confident of adoption; Measuring criteria:Hub test suites provide testUcoverage as much as the PM MojaSim test collection. Separate FSP test suites for validating FSP implementations

•	Support Schemes’ adoption of TTK; Measuring criteria: Support Mowali Scheme [or one scheme]

•	Providing enhancements for TechOps teams of Schemes; sage / UI enhancements based on community feedback;Sequence diagrams for default tests (based on event framework)

•	Automate steps for onboarding any new API [Stretch]

## Core:
•	Will include "Implement Cascading Timeouts " for Switch [Objectives will be same as the work-stream]

•	Maintenance: Provide design, PR reviews, critical fixes, Helm releases and general technical oversight for contributions to core services

##	Versioning: 
##	Code quality/security Initiative: The overall objective and goal of the initiative is to continuously improve the Trust (reliability, transparency, privacy, quality, and security) of the Mojaloop System by supporting both functional and non-functional requirements of the project, working alongside other workstreams & various governance committees on a shared responsibility model. For the current phase the key focus areas are as follows:

1. Enhance security in new functionality additions
2. Support major implementations
3. Design a secure cryptographic processing module
4. Improve data protection measures and controls
5. Baselining of Mojaloop against industry standards
6. Maintain and enhance secure DevOps/CI CD practices
7. Improve communication and community engagement
8. Improve access control measures
